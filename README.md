The app will allow service advisors to store and manage customer information, including their vehicles, service history, and any notes or comments they need to keep on file.

Installation
This app is currently in development and is not yet available for installation.

Usage

Service advisors will also be able to keep track of the services performed on each vehicle, as well as any comments or notes that they need to remember for future visits.

Technology
